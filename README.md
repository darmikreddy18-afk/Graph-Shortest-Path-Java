# Graph‑Shortest‑Path‑Java
A Java implementation of graph algorithms (BFS and Dijkstra’s Algorithm) to compute shortest paths in weighted graphs.

## Features
- Implements BFS for unweighted graphs.  
- Implements Dijkstra’s Algorithm for weighted graphs using a priority queue.  
- Console-based visualisation: step-by-step node visits and distance updates.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/darmikreddy18-afk/Graph-Shortest-Path-Java.git
2. Compile and run the main Java file  
   javac graph_shortest_path_project.java
   java graph_shortest_path_project

## What I Learned
- Graph data structures and adjacency list representation.  
- Implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm using a priority queue.  
- Writing clean, modular code and documenting algorithm steps.

## Future Improvements
- Add a GUI visualisation using JavaFX.  
- Allow user input of custom graphs.  
- Extend to directed graphs or alternative pathfinding algorithms.
